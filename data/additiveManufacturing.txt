Abstract. For ecological sustainability, the synthetic polymers are being continuously replaced 
by biopolymers due to their unique properties of biocompatibility and  biodegradability. Ploy-
lactic  acid  (PLA)  is  a  well-known  engineering  biopolymer  because  of  its  versatile  use  in 
bioengineering, textile and packing industries. For the customized engineering applications, the 
mechanical properties, namely tensile strength and shore hardness of PLA specimens printed by 
FDM  which  is  an  economical  3D  printed  technique  has  been  investigated  in  this  article. 
Taguchi’s L9 orthogonal array (OA) is used as a design of experiment. The influence of process 
parameters namely layer height, nozzle temperature, raster angle and surrounding pressure on 
mechanical properties of 3D printed specimens has been analysed by using Analysis of variance 
(ANOVA).  ANOVA  is  employed  to  identify  the  significance  and  percent  contribution  of  a 
particular process parameter on each mechanical property separately. In the end, grey relational 
analysis (GRA) is used as a multi-objective optimization tool to fabricate a better specimen with 
comprehensive mechanical properties.

1. Introduction. 
Over the past few years, Additive Manufacturing or 3D printing has gained great popularity by 
virtue of its ability to fabricate complex shapes with ease, size availability, easy handling, wide range 
of functional materials and its applications in engineering industry especially in aeronautics, 
construction,  automotive  industry,  textile  industry, food  industry  and  medical  sciences  Espalin et  al. 
[1]. Additive manufacturing has a number of methods which are being used as per their properties, some 
of these methods are stereolithography, selective layer sintering,  syringe extrusion, Fused Deposition 
Modelling  (also  known  as  Fused  Filament  Fabrication)  etc.  But  FDM  has  become  extensively 
implemented  technique  of  3D  printing  among  other  methods  Prashantha  and  Roger  [2].  In  FDM 
method, a heated printing head unit extrudes semi-liquid thermoplastic through a fixed orifice nozzle 
on a build area (printer bed) one layer upon other in order to form a 3-dimensional shape Alafaghani et 
al [3].

The relative motion between printing head and print bed in all three dimensions is governed by 
a software of computer aided manufacturing (Zein et al., 2002). Basics of a FDM 3D printer are shown 
in Figure 1(Sharma et al., 2021). 
Optimization of FDM process parameters has been a field of interest for researchers over  the 
last few years and studies have been performed to understand effects of different process parameters on 
different  characteristics  of 3D  printed  parts.  Through optimization  of  process  parameters,  a  range  of 
settings  can be  defined for a  FDM  3D printer  where  upon the  strength, printing time,  material used, 
dimensional accuracy or any other aspect of fabricated part can be optimized. Raster angle, layer height, 
line width, bed temperature and nozzle temperature are some of the most commonly optimized process 
parameters  [4–7].  Conventionally,  researchers  vary  one  process  parameter  while  keeping  others 
constant to study its effects and then next parameter. While this technique is proven to work but it is 
very time and resource consuming as number of experiments grow exponentially when more than one 
parameter is optimized and intersection terms of different parameters are not taken into consideration. 
To overcome this, Taguchi method is used in this  experimental study which is an efficient design of 
experiment method to screen a number of control parameters while keeping the number of experiments 
significantly low [8]. L9 orthogonal array of Taguchi’s method is used to study the effects of different 
process parameters on tensile strength and shore hardness of specimens. Subsequently, ANOVA is used 
to determine optimum process parameters with their effective contribution.  
2. Literature Review 
 (Srivastava et al. [4] Conducted a Response surface methodology (RSM) on FDM Maxum, 3D 
printer  using  ABS  thermoplastic  polymer.  Here,  a  hybrid  approach  was  proposed  to  optimize  the 
material volume of model along with built time through FDM by establishing optimal conditions as per 
grey analysis method with 0.654 mm contour width and 0.0254 mm air gap, orientated at 0.0° with 0º 
raster  angle.  Prashantha  and  Roger  [2]  printed  specimens  for  the  fabrication  of  conductive  polymer 
Nano  composites using FDM  based  3D printer. Parameters  set as nozzle temperature 210°  C  and its 
diameter, 0.4 mm. During printing, bed temperature was set at 60º C, while distance between the nozzle 
and bed was set at 0.2 mm. Printed specimens were of two surface layer shells stacked in between 45° 
and  -45º  at  0.2  mm  layer  height.  The  infill  density  was  chosen  100  percent  along  with  linear  infill 
pattern. Panda et al.[5] adopted a recently developed Bacterial foraging optimization algorithm due to 
its ease of implementation. By using surface method for prediction process, a functional relationship 
was developed between strength and process parameters like thickness, raster width, raster angle, build 
orientation and air gap. Hmeidat et al. [6] printed Nano composites using EPON 826 resin and DGEBPA 
resin having 178-186 weight per epoxide with density of 1.162 g/cc. The designed thermoset composite 
products  found  to  have  significant  higher  strength  range  of  80  to  143  MPa  because  of  cross-linked 
process,  resulted in excellent layer  to  layer  bonding.  Papon and  Haque  [7]  used  a  laboratory mixing 
extruder  to  develop  small batches  of  polymers  of  Poly  lactic  acid  biopolymers  (PLA)  and  Cellulose 
Nano fibril (CNF) filaments. PLA granulates of 3 mm were selected as matrix material that was melted 
at 175° C while, CNF with 400 nm length & average diameter of 50 nm used as reinforcement material. 
In  their  study,  it  was  concluded  that  CNF/PLA  Nano  composites  with  0.5  percent  CNF  results  in 
improved strength and modulus elasticity set against neat PLA. Extruder orifice and printer nozzle also 
affects  the  geometry  of  bed  spreading  and  orientation  of  CNF.  Cataldi  et  al.  [9]  produced  Nano 
composites  of  polyvinyl  alcohol  and  cellulose  Nano  crystals  using  a  single  screw  extruder.  In  the 
produced specimens PVOH was used as matrix material. It was found that, by introducing CNC  into 
the  composited  stiffness  of  filament  increased  which  resulted  in  tougher  and  less  dense  products. 
Alafaghani et al. [3] studied the effect of different control parameters on dimensional accuracy along 
with their  mechanical properties. In the  study, it was concluded that  the dimensional accuracy  along 
with  their  mechanical  properties of  the 3D  printed  material  were affected  more by  extrusion 
temperature, building direction and height of layer than the printing speed, infill pattern and percentage. 
B. Coppola et al. [10] did the comparative study of specimens of PLA and PLA/CLAY Nano composites 
at varying temperatures using FDM technique. In the study, semi-crystalline PLA was used as matrix 
and dog bone specimens were printed to mechanically test the samples at different temperatures: 185º 
C,  200º  C  and  215º  C.  It  was  concluded  that  Nano  composite  samples  exhibit  higher  modulus  of 
elasticity than the PLA specimens which increases with increasing printing temperature. Ceretti et al.

[11]  studied  the  effect  of  extrusion  technology  and  process  parameters  on  the  deposited  material  by 
producing multi-layered Poly-caprolactone (PCL) scaffolds varying configurations and adding human 
foreskin fibroblast cells at cellular density of 4000 cells/cm.  Though, any significant effect of extrusion 
head  on  the  geometry  of  samples  was  not  found  but  grain  extrusion  head  suggest  to  be  preferred. 
Bartolomeo Coppola et al. [12] studied the relation between printing temperature and the thermoplastic 
polymer architecture used in additive manufacturing technology. They produced the specimens of PLA 
reinforced  layer-wise  with  silicate  using  single  screw  extruder  at  10rpm  with  operating  temperature 
varied in the range of 160º C - 180° C. They fixed the nozzle diameter 0.35 mm, bed temperature at 50º 
C along with layer height 0.2 mm and raster angle at +/-45° C. From the study it was concluded that, 
transparency of a specimen is directly affected by printing temperature, as it increases with increases in 
temperature. (Balchan and Drickamer [13] studied the effects of pressure on the resistance of selenium 
and iodine in the specimens. They experimented in the pressure range of 60 to over 400 kbar and found 
a  sharp  drop  in  the  resistance  between  60  to  128  kbar  for  selenium  and  60  to  255  kbar  for  Iodine. 
Sobczak et al. [14] observed the influence of pressure in metal castings. Parameters such as nucleation 
growth, interfacial energy, phase diagrams and diffusion coefficient were considered. It was concluded 
that reduced critical radius, decreased interfacial free energy and reduced rate of new phase nucleation 
resulted  in refinement structure  formation.  Dean and Unal  [8]  notified  the  benefits  of using  Taguchi 
technique in the specimen’s production and stated that Taguchi method is a powerful tool to produce 
products with robust quality and improved cost efficiency, simultaneously. Mohan Pandey et al. [15] 
explained layered manufacturing into two categories. The slicing algorithms employed in the process 
have  been  classified  into  rectangular  build  edge  and  slope.  Ahn  et  al.  [16]  presented  formulation  of 
surface roughness in the specimens produced by FDM technique. They concluded that cross-section of 
filament, surface angle, thickness of layer  influences the surface roughness of fabricated FDM parts. 
Boschetto and Bottini [17] performed a case study with 60 different deposition angles taken in the range 
0° to180֯ using a thermoplastic polymer, ABS and prepared a method to predict surface roughness and 
dimensional  accuracy.  After  investigation,  they  concluded  that  the  process  parameters  like  layer 
thickness and deposition angle greatly influence the dimensional deviations. Bellini et al. [18] evolved 
a new extrusion method by using granules rather than filament in the field of fused deposition modelling 
of ceramics to overcome the limitations of filaments being used. Pandey et al. [19] evaluated surface 
roughness of FDM part which majorly caused due to staircase effect. They presented a semi empirical 
model  and  used  HCM  (Hot  cutter  machine).  ANOVA  was  used  to  evaluate  the  significant  index  of 
process and concluded that, by using HCM method, 0.3 μm level of surface finish has been achieved 
with 87% confidence level.  
The intensive literature review indicates that in order to optimize mechanical properties of 3D 
printed parts through FDM process, usually the process parameters which are controlled through FDM 
machine  itself  are  optimized  and  external  conditions  such  as  surrounding  temperature,  surrounding 
pressure,  humidity  etc.  are  not  taken  into  account.  The  quality  characteristics  of  3D  printed  parts  is 
affected by the external factors, physicist P.W. Bridgman [20] conducted a thorough study on properties 
and characteristics of materials under high pressure. J.D. Bernal [21] stated that under sufficiently high 
pressure, all matter should behave like metals. In this study one of these factors, surrounding pressure 
is taken under consideration for optimization and treated as a process parameter. Taguchi technique and 
GRA together are proven as a  great tool for the purpose of multi-objective optimization as so that is 
why these analysis methods are employed as well.  
3. Experimentation 
3.1 Process parameters and their range 
After  intensive  literature  review,  the  process  parameters  like  layer  height,  raster  angle  and 
nozzle temperature have been greatly influenced the mechanical properties of 3D printed specimens. In 
this research study, a new process parameter, i.e., surrounding pressure is taken under consideration in 
order  to  understand  its  influence  on  the  mechanical  properties  such  as  tensile  strength  and  shore 
hardness of FDM 3D printed specimens. To perform experimentation, L9 orthogonal array of Taguchi’s 
design of experiment have employed in which each process parameter considered at three levels. These 
three levels are selected based on 3D printer manual and pilot test performed on a 3D printer. The ranges

and subsequent levels of variable process parameters taken for this study are as shown in Table  1. In 
3D printing of specimens, some process parameters of FDM 3D printer have taken fixed during each 
experiment, which are as follows: bed temperature at 60° C, 0.4 mm nozzle diameter, relative density 
at 100%, printing speed at 3600 mm/min, three number of solid layers and 0.4 mm extrusion width.

3.2 Materials 
The polylactic acid (PLA) filament, white colour, of diameter 1.75 ± 0.03 mm was selected to 
print the test specimens for analysing the mechanical properties. PLA, a thermoplastic polyester, is one 
of the most commonly used 3D printing filaments and its chemical formula is (C3H4O2)n.  
3.3 Experimental Setup 
FDM machine used for sample preparation is Inferno i3 3D printer. Maximum print volume for 
this  particular  model  is  220*220*250  mm.  ABS  (Acrylonitrile  butadiene  styrene),  PVA  (Polyvinyl 
Alcohol), PLA (Polylactic Acid), high density polyethylene and similar materials can be used to print 
by this  3D printer.  A print bed  that can be  heated is installed in this printer which is very helpful to 
adhere  the  bottom  layer  of  the  specimen.  Firmware  used  in  this  machine  is  Marlin.  To  print  on  this 
machine G-code of the part is send to the printer with a SD card or over USB. The FDM printer is kept 
inside the air-tight pressure chamber and the lid of the chamber is shut closed with the help of fasteners, 
the air compressor is turned on to increase the air pressure around FDM printer, the compressed air is 
first filled in the cylinder of compressor and then transferred to the pressure chamber containing FDM 
machine with the help of a high-pressure pipe.

Desired pressure is set in the pressure switch which automatically turns the compressor off 
once that pressure is achieved. After maintaining required surrounding pressure, FDM process starts, 
the test specimen is printed and pressure is released, then specimen is taken out and whole process is 
repeated to print next specimen. Thus, a pressure chamber along with an air compressor is used to 
control and change surrounding pressure as per the requirement, the printer is kept inside pressure 
chamber. All other process parameters are set while creating the G-code file and sent to the printer 
along with the G-code. The experimental setup used in this study is displayed in Figure 2 [22]. 
 
3.4 Sample Preparation 
In this study, ISO 527-2 (Model 5A) standard is used for testing of tensile properties of PLA 
[23]. Figure 3 [22] shows shape and dimensions in mm used to prepare CAD 3D model for samples. 
Samples are 3D printed using PLA on Inferno i3 FDM 3D printer.  
Figure 3: CAD model of tensile specimen 
To  understand  the  effects  of  process  parameter  variation  on  tensile  strength  of  FDM  produced 
specimens,  the  specimens  were  fabricated  as  per  ISO  527-2  standard  and  tested  on  Tax-care  digital 
tensile  testing  machine.  Shore  hardness  of  specimens  was  also  measured  using  a  shore  durometer. 
Figure 4 shows fractured specimen after tensile testing.

3.5 Experimental design using Taguchi technique 
Taguchi method is an efficient technique to design experiments for a process with multiple variables in 
order  to  upgrade  the  product  quality  when  experimenter  ought  to  keep  number  of  experiments 
significantly low[24]. Taguchi method is used in this study to evaluate the effects of control factors of 
FDM process on the mechanical properties of FDM printed specimens. 
In  Taguchi  methodology,  quality  of  a  product  is  realized  as  an  estimation  of  loss  to  the  society 
interconnected  with  that  product.  Here,  loss  can  be  defined  as  deviations  and  variations  found  in 
function of the product. A comparison of how much each unit differs from other in the way it operates 
shows loss from variation in function, greater variance means more significant loss. This study focuses

on strength of specimens which is desired as high as possible, so “higher the better” method of quality 
characteristics is preferred for the responses. Equation (1) shows the formula used to calculate S/N ratio.

4. Results and Discussion  
Figure 5 shows the effects of control factors on desired mechanical properties namely, tensile strength 
and shore hardness of FDM produced specimens, a graph is plotted between mean of S/N ratios of each 
parameter at different levels and as our approach here is “higher the better”, parameters at level A1, B3, 
C2 and D1 are best suitable in order to achieve maximum tensile strength. In a similar fashion, parameter 
A3, B2, C1 and D2 forms best setting which ensures maximum shore hardness.

Analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  is  performed  in  order  to  understand  significance  of  each  process 
parameter on tensile strength and shore hardness of final part respectively. Table 3 reveals that nozzle 
temperature (Factor C) is the highest significant control factor which affects tensile strength of FDM 
produced part with 45.74% contribution followed by layer height (Factor A) which contributes 27.86%, 
raster angle (Factor B) has 24.95% contribution while surrounding pressure (Factor D) turns out to be 
an insignificant factor for tensile strength within the range considered in this study.

part. Layer height (Factor A) proved to be the highest significant parameter having a contribution share 
of 63.51% followed by raster angle (Factor B) and nozzle temperature (Factor C) with a contribution of 
23.25% and 12.43% respectively while surrounding pressure (Factor D) is an insignificant factor here 
as well. 
4.1 Grey Relational Analysis 
Grey  relational  analysis  (GRA)  is  used  in  this  study  as  a  method  of  multi-objective  optimization. 
Multiple attributes of a  decision making problem are consolidated into a  single value in this method 
[25].  The data obtained from Taguchi’s method is processed into grey relational coefficient and then 
subsequently processed into grey relational grade (GRG), GRG is an index which deals with multiple 
performance characteristics. The data received from S/N ratio of tensile strength and shore hardness is 
processed  into  linear  normalization,  original  sequence  is  converted  between  0.00  and  1.00  for  the 
purpose of comparison, it is known as grey relational generating. Equation (2) is used for normalization 
of original data. For a multi-objective optimization, it is observed that highest performance is indicated 
by highest GRG [26]. 
𝑥𝑖∗(𝑡)= 𝑥𝑖𝑜(𝑡)−𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑥𝑖𝑜(𝑡)
𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑥𝑖𝑜(𝑡)−𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑥𝑖𝑜(𝑡)                      (2) 
Where, 𝑥𝑖∗(𝑡) represents normalized value of tth response within ith experiment, 𝑥𝑖𝑜(𝑡) represents original 
sequence value of tth response within ith experiment, min𝑥𝑖𝑜 (𝑡) and max𝑥𝑖𝑜(𝑡) represents lowest and 
highest values of 𝑥𝑖𝑜(𝑡) respectively. Equation (3) is used to calculate grey relational coefficient which 
is then used to establish a correlation between best value and experimental value.

4.2 Confirmation Experiment 
A  confirmation  experiment  is  preformed  to  validate  the  results  obtained  through  analysis.  Process 
parameters for confirmation experiment are considered as per experiment 2 which should give optimum 
values  of  tensile  strength  and  shore  hardness.  Satisfactory  results  are  obtained  after  confirmation 
experiment which are shown in Table 6.

4.3 Surface Morphology 
In order to analyse and study micro-structure of FDM produced parts, microscopic evaluation was done 
using an optical microscope. It is observed that by increasing the layer height, the irregularities between 
two layers are to be increased that can be perceived in Fig. 6, 7 and 8.
