      "In this essay, the author is reflecting on their early experiences with writing and programming, from working on short stories as a young person to learning about computers and AI later on. They discuss how they first encountered computers through friends and eventually bought their own TRS-80 in the early 1980s. The author also shares their journey of transitioning from studying philosophy to pursuing AI, influenced by works like Heinlein's novel and a PBS documentary showcasing Terry Winograd using SHRDLU."
